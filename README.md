# Advent of Code Solutions

This repository contains my solutions for advent of code throughout the years. 

It is organised as such:

```
year -> day -> (optional) language
```

The majority of these solutions are written in Haskell, using Stack. To run these, first ensure Stack and GHC are installed, navigate to the directory, and run `stack run` (or `stack ghci`, followed by `main`).
